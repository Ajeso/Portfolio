# Portfolio


This my personal portfolio 



I figured this is the one of the ways I could put into practice my skills since I started web-Development. I incorporated the almost everything that I have learned this couple of months and I hope that as time goes by and I acquire more skills I'll look back at this portfolio as one of my big achievements.



This repository basicly contains alot of HTML and CSS  and alittle bit of Javascript. I'm still learning Javascript and I didn't want to use any framework libraries given it's my first project.




You're welcome to check it out and let me know if there is a place I could have done better. Your input is highly welcomed.
